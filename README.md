# SportsProject
Jupyter Notebook and CSV repository for my project analyzing and simulating different sports leagues
The initial goal of this project was to see out of four major sports leagues, EPL (English Premier League), MLB (Major League Baseball), NBA (National Basketball Association), and NFL (National Football League), in which is the theoretical best team most likely to win the championship. 
From that simple question, I ended up analyzing many more details about these very different leagues. 
This project was split into three main phases:
1. Analyzing historical game data for EPL, MLB, NBA, and NFL
2. Simulating seasons for each of the four leagues, analyzing the results, and comparing them
3. Testing how expanding or contracting the MLB playoffs affects how often the best team wins the championship

The main branch houses the final Jupyter workbooks for the project
The CSV-Supporting-Files branch is for source files that are used by workbooks
The CSV-Results branch is for results CSV files some of which are also used by workbooks
The Different-MLB-Scenarios branch is the source code for the third phase of the project
